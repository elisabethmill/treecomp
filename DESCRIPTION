Description: This package extracts similarity scores from fitted random forest objects
  (randomForest or ranger) corresponding to the distances implied by the adaptive nearest neighbors
  interpretation of random forests. These similarity scores can be interpreted as providing the
  "comps", or comparable training/reference data points, for the new data points provided. When the
  training data are used as the reference data, the random forest prediction is equivalent to the
  weighted average of the training data outcomes, weighted according to the similarity scores.
